# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Petruss!

I enjoy creating fun and innovative projects. Here you'll find my work on Roblox development, open source contributions, and other exciting experiments.

I'm currently learning front-end development and plan to learn back-end development in the future.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out for collaboration ideas. Let's create something amazing together!
